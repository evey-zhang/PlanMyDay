# PLAN MY DAY GROUP 35

Introduction: Plan My Day helps improve the experience of new tourists in Los Angeles and University of Southern California by suggesting 
tourist attractions in both areas. Based on the userâ€™s preferences, the app will create a route on Google Maps so our tourists 
can experience as much as possible during their visit to the Los Angeles area.
